# 4sigma - application frontend

DEMO: https://4sigma.micorix.dev

## Docs

### Current stack / implementation

* We implemented our frontend using TypeScript, React NextJS
* Initial backend (not further developed, cause of time) -> https://github.com/student-hackathon-team/collabothon2023-backend

### Target state / stack

* Use of Instant Payments API by CommerzBank
* Use of S3-compatible media storage or SeaweedFS adapter to allow scaling
* We developed the web app because it allowed us for rapid prototyping. We hope that 4sigma would be the mobile app with great native UX and feel
* Backend could be dockerized and deployed to the K8S cluster or to the cloud

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
